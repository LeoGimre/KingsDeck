  "content": "In normal chess the board is always set up in the same way. In King’s Deck, however, you control what pieces to bring to the board, and where to place them. As stated previously, all pieces have different “point values”. These values indicate how strong a piece is, and as such is limited to a smaller number.\n\nDeck limits\nIn King’s Deck you can chose the max number of points your deck contains. These limits are 40, 60, 80 and 100 respectively. The number of spell slots you have do NOT change with point limits, however, spells still take up points – You must decide if you want to have more pieces or max out on spells!\nThe deck does not need to have its capacity maxed out; however, a deck is only allowed to play in its class. Therefore a 40-point maximum deck cannot play against a 100-point maximum deck.\nKeep this in mind when building your deck of pieces and spells. Maximizing your points is a good way to always have the highest chance to beat your opponent!\n\n Choosing the right pieces and spells\nEveryone has different preferences and favourite pieces, and King’s Deck is all about choosing the right pieces for your playstyle. Do keep in mind that the point hierarchy is there for a reason! Someone with a board full of Queens and Dragons is going to be a scary one to face, but they wont have as many pieces as someone who chooses to fill their ranks with Rooks, Bishops and Knights!\nSome spells only work on certain pieces. Keep this in mind when building your deck as you don’t want to have spells you cannot use!",
